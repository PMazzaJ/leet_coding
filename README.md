# LeetCode Study Solutions

This repository was created for study purposes. Here you will find my solutions to [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/) exercises.

## Structure

- Folders are organized first by **difficulty** (e.g. `Easy`, `Medium`, `Hard`), and then by **topic** (e.g. `Array`, `String`, `DynamicProgramming`).
- Solution files are stored inside the relevant topic folder, grouped by difficulty.
- Example:
  ```
  leetcode_solutions/
    ├── Easy/
    │   ├── Array/
    │   │   └── two_sum.rb
    │   ├── String/
    │   │   └── is_palindrome.rb
    ├── Medium/
    │   ├── DynamicProgramming/
    │   │   └── coin_change.rb
    └── Hard/
        └── Graph/
            └── shortest_path.rb
  ```

## Usage

Open the file for the exercise you want to check.  
Each file contains the source code for the solution and, in some cases, comments about the approach used.

## Notes

- This repository is for personal study and practice only.
- Solutions may be updated or improved over time.
- There is no guarantee that all solutions are the most optimized.
