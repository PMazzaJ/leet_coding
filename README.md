# LeetCode Study Solutions

Here you will find **my own solutions** to [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/) exercises.

## Structure

- Folders are organized first by **difficulty** (e.g. `Easy`, `Medium`, `Hard`), and then by **topic** (e.g. `Array`, `String`, `DynamicProgramming`).
- Solution files are stored inside the relevant topic folder, grouped by difficulty.
- Example:
  ```
  leetcode_solutions/
    ├── Easy/
    │   ├── Array/
    │   │   └── two_sum.rb
    │   ├── String/
    │   │   └── is_palindrome.rb
    ├── Medium/
    │   ├── DynamicProgramming/
    │   │   └── coin_change.rb
    └── Hard/
        └── Graph/
            └── shortest_path.rb
  ```

## Usage

Open the file for the exercise you want to check.  
Each file contains the source code for the solution and, in some cases, comments about the approach I used.

## Notes

- These are **my solutions**, reflecting my understanding and approach at the time I solved each problem.
- The solutions are not necessarily the most optimal or the best possible; they simply show how I arrived at my answer.
- This repository is for personal study and practice only.
- Solutions may be updated or improved over time.
